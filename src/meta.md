# Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box…

Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.

Me fail English? That's unpossible. __Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance.__ *We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus?* That came out of left field.

## Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.

A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. I stand by my racial slur. Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.

1. Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.
2. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!
3. I stand by my racial slur.

### Me fail English? That's unpossible.

Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. Inflammable means flammable? What a country.

* A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.
* I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.
* Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me!

What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?

Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway.

Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life.

Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.

I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker.

I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.

I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me?

I hope I didn't brain my damage. But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life. What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?

Please do not offer my god a peanut. You don't win friends with salad. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.

Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."
