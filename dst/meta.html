<p>Oh, I&#39;m in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don&#39;t have to listen to myself. I&#39;m drunk. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. How could you?! Haven&#39;t you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn&#39;t hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>

<p>Me fail English? That&#39;s unpossible. <strong>Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance.</strong> <em>We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus?</em> That came out of left field.</p>

<p>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. I stand by my racial slur. Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.</p>

<ol>
<li>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.</li>
<li>Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!</li>
<li>I stand by my racial slur.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Me%20fail%20English?%20That&amp;#39;s%20unpossible.">Me fail English? That&#39;s unpossible.</h3>

<p>Last night&#39;s &quot;Itchy and Scratchy Show&quot; was, without a doubt, the worst episode <em>ever.</em> Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. Inflammable means flammable? What a country.</p>

<li>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.</li>
<li>I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.</li>
<li>Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me!</li>
</ul>

<p>What good is money if it can&#39;t inspire terror in your fellow man? Donuts. Is there anything they can&#39;t do? I&#39;m normally not a praying man, but if you&#39;re up there, please save me, Superman. How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?</p>

<p>Slow down, Bart! My legs don&#39;t know how to be as long as yours. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. What&#39;s the point of going out? We&#39;re just going to wind up back here anyway.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You&#39;re from two different worlds… Oh, I&#39;ve wasted my life.</p>

<p>Beer. Now there&#39;s a temporary solution. Last night&#39;s &quot;Itchy and Scratchy Show&quot; was, without a doubt, the worst episode <em>ever.</em> Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#39;s what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker.</p>

<p>I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.</p>

<p>I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. Books are useless! I only ever read one book, &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird,&quot; and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does <em>that</em> do me?</p>

<p>I hope I didn&#39;t brain my damage. But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You&#39;re from two different worlds… Oh, I&#39;ve wasted my life. What good is money if it can&#39;t inspire terror in your fellow man?</p>

<p>Please do not offer my god a peanut. You don&#39;t win friends with salad. Old people don&#39;t need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</p>

<p>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you&#39;d step over your own mother just to get one! But you can&#39;t stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! Well, he&#39;s kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace &quot;accidentally&quot; with &quot;repeatedly&quot; and replace &quot;dog&quot; with &quot;son.&quot;</p>

<p>Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#39;s what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. Old people don&#39;t need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</p>
