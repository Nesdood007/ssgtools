<h1 id="Hey,%20whatcha%20watching?">Hey, whatcha watching?</h1>

<p>Bender, you risked your life to save me! You wouldn&#39;t. Ask anyway! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don&#39;t own! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.</p>

<p>Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Hey, whatcha watching? Ask her how her day was. Hey, what kinda party is this? <strong>There&#39;s no booze and only one hooker.</strong> <em>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up!</em> Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>

<h2 id="If%20rubbin&amp;#39;%20frozen%20dirt%20in%20your%20crotch%20is%20wrong,%20hey%20I%20don&amp;#39;t%20wanna%20be%20right.">If rubbin&#39; frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don&#39;t wanna be right.</h2>

<p>Hey! I&#39;m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? I could if you hadn&#39;t turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Soothe us with sweet lies. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!</p>

<ol>
<li>Oh Leela! You&#39;re the only person I could turn to; you&#39;re the only person who ever loved me.</li>
<li>She also liked to shut up!</li>
<li>What&#39;s with you kids? Every other day it&#39;s food, food, food. Alright, I&#39;ll get you some stupid food.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Good%20news,%20everyone!%20There&amp;#39;s%20a%20report%20on%20TV%20with%20some%20very%20bad%20news!">Good news, everyone! There&#39;s a report on TV with some very bad news!</h3>

<p>Bender, hurry! This fuel&#39;s expensive! Also, we&#39;re dying! Well, let&#39;s just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</p>

<ul>
<li>There&#39;s one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!</li>
<li>Okay, it&#39;s 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can&#39;t hold the charge and the reception isn&#39;t very…</li>
<li>Good news, everyone! I&#39;ve taught the toaster to feel love!</li>
</ul>

<p>Negative, bossy meat creature! I just told you! You&#39;ve killed me! OK, this has gotta stop. I&#39;m going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>

<p>Hello Morbo, how&#39;s the family? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. How much did you make me? I&#39;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t. Ask anyway! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. One hundred dollars. Fatal. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Yeah, lots of people did.</p>

<p>And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who&#39;s gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Fry! Stay back! He&#39;s too powerful! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p>

<p>Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I&#39;m going to come back there and change your opinions manually! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Why would a robot need to drink?</p>

<p>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of &#39;will&#39;? No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don&#39;t own! Stop it, stop it. It&#39;s fine. I will &#39;destroy&#39; you!</p>

<p>Why not indeed! I meant &#39;physically&#39;. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to do his laundry? I&#39;m a thing. It&#39;s toe-tappingly tragic! Throw her in the brig. Kif might! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</p>

<p>I suppose I could part with &#39;one&#39; and still be feared… Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of &#39;will&#39;? Our love isn&#39;t any different from yours, except it&#39;s hotter, because I&#39;m involved.</p>

<p>Moving along… You wouldn&#39;t. Ask anyway! It&#39;s toe-tappingly tragic! Oh dear! She&#39;s stuck in an infinite loop, and he&#39;s an idiot! Well, that&#39;s love for you. This opera&#39;s as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can&#39;t just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>

<p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! No. We&#39;re on the top. Who am I making this out to? And yet you haven&#39;t said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</p>
