<h1 id="We&amp;#39;re%20also%20Santa%20Claus!">We&#39;re also Santa Claus!</h1>

<p>Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You&#39;d think it would be something you&#39;d have to freebase. Alright, let&#39;s mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.</p>

<p>And yet you haven&#39;t said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! <strong>What&#39;s with you kids?</strong> <em>Every other day it&#39;s food, food, food.</em> Alright, I&#39;ll get you some stupid food.</p>

<h2 id="There,%20now%20he&amp;#39;s%20trapped%20in%20a%20book%20I%20wrote:%20a%20crummy%20world%20of%20plot%20holes%20and%20spelling%20errors!">There, now he&#39;s trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</h2>

<p>Guess again. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! We&#39;ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we&#39;ll go home. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</p>

<ol>
<li>You know, I was God once.</li>
<li>Morbo can&#39;t understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that&#39;s shaped like a man wearing a hat.</li>
<li>With gusto.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Of%20all%20the%20friends%20I&amp;#39;ve%20had%E2%80%A6%20you&amp;#39;re%20the%20first.">Of all the friends I&#39;ve had… you&#39;re the first.</h3>

<p>There&#39;s no part of that sentence I didn&#39;t like! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! You don&#39;t know how to do any of those. Say it in Russian!</p>

<ul>
<li>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!</li>
<li>Hey, what kinda party is this? There&#39;s no booze and only one hooker.</li>
<li>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you&#39;d cease to exist!</li>
</ul>

<p>Eeeee! Now say &quot;nuclear wessels&quot;! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Yeah, lots of people did. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>

<p>Hey, guess what you&#39;re accessories to. It must be wonderful. Bender, being God isn&#39;t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</p>

<p>Who&#39;s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I love this planet! I&#39;ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>

<p>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. I saw you with those two &quot;ladies of the evening&quot; at Elzars. Explain that. Professor, make a woman out of me.</p>

<p>Our love isn&#39;t any different from yours, except it&#39;s hotter, because I&#39;m involved. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Michelle, I don&#39;t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>

<p>Why would a robot need to drink? Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Ah, the &#39;Breakfast Club&#39; soundtrack! I can&#39;t wait til I&#39;m old enough to feel ways about stuff!</p>

<p>I found what I need. And it&#39;s not friends, it&#39;s things. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Tell her she looks thin. It&#39;s okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</p>

<p>Well, then good news! It&#39;s a suppository. Kids don&#39;t turn rotten just from watching TV. Your best is an idiot! Daylight and everything. Leela, Bender, we&#39;re going grave robbing.</p>

<p>Really?! I found what I need. And it&#39;s not friends, it&#39;s things. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</p>

<p>You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Hey! I&#39;m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</p>
